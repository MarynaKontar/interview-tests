 * Anonymous Inner class that extends a class :
 * We can have an anonymous inner class that extends a class.
 * For example,we know that we can create a thread by extending a Thread class.
 * Suppose we need an immediate thread but we donâ€™t want to create a class that extend Thread class all the time.
 * By the help of this type of Anonymous Inner class we can define a ready thread as follows
